## Code

This is an inline `code block()`, and the following is an indented code block:

    // Comment
    print 'this is indented code block'
    print 'line 2'
    print 'line 3'

### Code block fences

```javascript
console.log("Hello World")
```

```
// Language not specified
function hello() {
  console.log("Hello!");
}
```
## Math Equations

Lift($L$) can be determined by Lift Coefficient ($C_L$) like the following equation.

$$
L = \frac{1}{2} \rho v^2 S C_L
$$

When $a \ne 0$, there are two solutions to $(ax^2 + bx + c = 0)$ and they are
$$x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.$$
